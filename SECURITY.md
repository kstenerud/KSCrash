## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in KSCrash, please report it responsibly.

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature:

1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/kstenerud/KSCrash/security) of this repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the form with details about the vulnerability

### What to Include

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations (if known)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial response**: Within 72 hours
- **Status update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix timeline**: Depends on severity, typically within 30-90 days

### Disclosure Policy

We follow responsible disclosure practices. Once a fix is available, we will:

1. Release a patched version
2. Publish a security advisory
3. Credit the reporter (unless they prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Best Practices for Users

When using KSCrash in your application:

- Always use the latest stable version
- Review crash reports before transmitting them, as they may contain sensitive information
- Use HTTPS endpoints for crash report submission
- Consider the privacy implications of the data collected in crash reports
