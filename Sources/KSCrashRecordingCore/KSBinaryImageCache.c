/// As a general rule, access to _g_all_image_infos->infoArray_ is thread safe
/// in a way that you can iterate all you want since items will never be removed
/// and the _infoCount_ is only updated after an item is added to _infoArray_.
/// Because of this, we can iterate during a signal handler, Mach exception handler
/// or even at any point within the run of the process.
