 * Monitor list lockless algorithm:

 * We choose an array of 100 entries because there will never be that many monitors in existence. No further allocations
 * are made.
 * - To iterate: Traverse the entire array, ignoring any null pointers.
 * - To add an entry:
 *   - Search the array for a hole (null pointer)
 *   - Try to atomically swap in the monitor API pointer.
 *   - If the swap fails, continue searching for the next hole and repeat.
 *   - Once a swap is successful, iterate again, removing duplicates in case someone else also added the same API.
 * - To remove an entry: Search for the pointer in the array and swap it for null.
