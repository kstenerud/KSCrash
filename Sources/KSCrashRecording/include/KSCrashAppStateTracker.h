/**
 * KSCrashAppStateTracker
 *
 * This system tracks the app state, but also gives insight into the transitions
 * from launch to termination. One reason why this is useful is that when a user
 * brings a running process to the foreground, it goes through an animation from
 * background to foreground that is not accounted for in UIApplicationState but
 * is still visible to users. If the app crashes or is temrinated during that time, the
 * application state is `UIApplicationStateBackground` which is usually not
 * accounted for in crash systems. This newer method with transitions included in
 * the state is much more complete and allows products to be much more reliable
 * and handle areas of the app that are very important to users but rarely handled
 * by apps.
 *
 * We'll keep it private for now until it is integrated with `KSCrashMonitor_AppState`.
