/**
 * Application Memory
 *
 * There are two kinds of app memory handled here, LIMIT and PRESSURE.
 *
 * LIMIT
 * Limit (aka AppMemoryLevel) is the maximum amount of memory you can use by through
 * things like malloc, object allocations and so on (mostly heap). Once you hit this high-water
 * mark, the OS will terminate the application by sending it a SIGKILL signal. This is valid in
 * the foreground as well as the background.
 *
 * PRESSURE
 * Pressure (aka AppMemoryPressure) is how much the iOS ecosystem is pushing on the
 * current app to be a good memory citizen. Usually, when your app is in the foreground it
 * has a high priority thus doesn't get too much pressure. But there are exceptions such as
 * CarPlay apps, music apps and so on that can sometimes have a higher priority than the
 * foreground app, this is where pressure can come in very handy. That being said, pressure
 * is mostly useful in the background, it can help you not get your app jetsamed or simply
 * stay up longer for whatever reason you might have.
 *
 * My recommendation around memory pressure however is to have a robust app restoration
 * system and not bother too much with background memory, as long as your foreground
 * memory consumption is well handled.
 *
 * RECS
 * Follow the memory limit with an eagle eye. Make sure you act upon the changes as they
 * happen instead of all at once as with `didReceiveMemoryWarning`. Don't simple drop
 * everything you have in memory. Take it step by step. An good way to do this is to keep your
 * cache total cost limits in line with the memory limit.
